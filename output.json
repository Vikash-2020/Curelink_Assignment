Bhindi (okra) is a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and folate which are beneficial for your PCOS condition. Oats roti is a healthier alternative to regular wheat roti as it is high in fiber and helps in managing blood sugar levels. \n\nApples are a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin C. They are also low in calories and high in water content, which can help you feel full. \n\nRemember, consistency is key in managing PCOS. Keep up the good work!",
